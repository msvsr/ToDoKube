We have deployed a few pods in this cluster in various namespaces. Inspect them and identify the pod which is not in a Ready state. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

Next, add a check to restart the container on the same pod if the command ls /var/www/html/file_check fails. This check should start after a delay of 10 seconds and run every 60 seconds.

You may delete and recreate the object. Ignore the warnings from the probe.

## Watch for container port carefully.
