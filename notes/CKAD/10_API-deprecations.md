In Kubernetes, API objects can have multiple versions, and understanding the distinction between the preferred version and the storage version is important for API evolution and backward compatibility.

### Preferred Version

- **Definition**: The preferred version is the version of the API that Kubernetes recommends clients to use when interacting with a specific resource. It is typically the most recent stable version.
- **Usage**: When you perform operations such as `kubectl get`, `kubectl apply`, etc., the preferred version is used by default unless you specify a different version explicitly.
- **Purpose**: It helps to ensure clients are using the most up-to-date and stable API version. It simplifies the user experience by providing a default version.

### Storage Version

- **Definition**: The storage version is the version of the API that the Kubernetes API server uses to store the objects in etcd (the underlying storage system for Kubernetes). There is only one storage version for each resource.
- **Usage**: Internally, when the API server reads from or writes to etcd, it uses the storage version. When clients interact with the API, the server converts the object from the storage version to the requested version and vice versa.
- **Purpose**: It ensures consistency and efficiency in how objects are stored in etcd. By storing objects in a single version, the system can avoid complications related to managing multiple versions in storage.

### Interaction between Preferred and Storage Versions

1. **Conversion**: When an API request is made using a version different from the storage version, the API server handles the conversion between the requested version and the storage version transparently. This allows clients to interact with the API using the preferred version without needing to worry about storage details.
2. **Upgrade and Compatibility**: During Kubernetes upgrades, the storage version might be updated to a newer API version. Kubernetes ensures backward compatibility by providing conversion mechanisms so that objects can be accessed using both old and new versions.

### Example

Assume you have a custom resource `MyResource` with versions `v1beta1` and `v1`. If `v1` is the preferred version and the storage version is `v1beta1`:

- **Preferred Version**: When you run `kubectl get myresources`, the API server uses `v1` by default.
- **Storage Version**: Internally, the API server stores `MyResource` objects in etcd using the `v1beta1` format. When you request `v1`, the API server converts the stored `v1beta1` object to `v1`.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing API versioning and ensuring smooth upgrades in Kubernetes clusters.



API groups in Kubernetes allow for the organization and versioning of APIs, enabling the system to evolve over time while maintaining backward compatibility. This design makes it easier to manage and extend the Kubernetes API. Hereâ€™s an overview of API groups in Kubernetes:

### Core Group

- **Core (Legacy) API**: The core group contains the foundational resources necessary for Kubernetes operation, such as `Pod`, `Service`, `ReplicationController`, `Node`, and `Namespace`. These resources are part of the core API and do not have a group name. For example, `v1` is often used to refer to the core API version.
- **URL Path**: `/api/v1/...`

### Named Groups

- **Definition**: Named API groups organize resources into logical categories, often representing different functionalities or extensions to the core Kubernetes API.
- **URL Path**: `/apis/<group>/<version>/...`

### Examples of Named API Groups

1. **apps**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages higher-level application concepts, such as deployments, stateful sets, and daemon sets.
   - **URL Path**: `/apis/apps/v1/...`

2. **batch**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages batch and cron jobs.
   - **URL Path**: `/apis/batch/v1/...`

3. **autoscaling**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles resources related to automatic scaling, such as horizontal pod autoscalers.
   - **URL Path**: `/apis/autoscaling/v1/...`

4. **networking.k8s.io**:
   - **Purpose**: Deals with network-related resources, such as network policies and ingress resources.
   - **URL Path**: `/apis/networking.k8s.io/v1/...`

5. **rbac.authorization.k8s.io**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages role-based access control (RBAC) resources, including roles and role bindings.
   - **URL Path**: `/apis/rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/...`

6. **apiextensions.k8s.io**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages custom resource definitions (CRDs), allowing users to define their own API resources.
   - **URL Path**: `/apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/...`

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- **Purpose**: CRDs allow users to extend the Kubernetes API with their own resource types, which are organized into their own API groups.
- **URL Path**: `/apis/<custom-group>/<version>/...`

### Benefits of API Groups

1. **Modularity**: API groups help modularize the Kubernetes API, making it easier to manage and extend.
2. **Versioning**: Each group can have multiple versions, allowing for smoother upgrades and backward compatibility.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Different API groups allow different teams or communities to manage and evolve parts of the Kubernetes API independently.

### Accessing API Groups

To list available API groups in your cluster, you can use the `kubectl api-versions` command:

```sh
kubectl api-versions
```

This command outputs the available API versions, grouped by their respective API groups.

API groups are a powerful feature of Kubernetes that support a scalable and extensible architecture, enabling the addition of new features and resources while maintaining stability and compatibility.




API deprecations in Kubernetes are a key part of the system's lifecycle management, ensuring that outdated or less efficient API versions are phased out in favor of newer, more robust versions. Understanding how deprecations work is important for maintaining and upgrading Kubernetes clusters.

### What is API Deprecation?

- **Definition**: API deprecation is the process of marking a specific API version as outdated and scheduled for removal in a future Kubernetes release.
- **Purpose**: It allows the Kubernetes project to evolve by removing older, less efficient, or insecure API versions, making way for improvements and new features.

### Deprecation Lifecycle

1. **Announcement**: Deprecation of an API version is announced in the release notes of a particular Kubernetes version. This typically happens at least one release cycle before the actual removal.
2. **Deprecation Warning**: When an API version is deprecated, Kubernetes emits warnings when the deprecated version is used, advising users to transition to a newer version.
3. **Removal**: The deprecated API version is eventually removed in a future release, typically after one or two release cycles, giving users ample time to migrate.

### Identifying Deprecated APIs

- **Release Notes**: Deprecations are listed in the release notes for each Kubernetes release.
- **API Server Warnings**: When you use a deprecated API, Kubernetes emits a warning message to the client, usually visible in the command-line interface or API server logs.

### Handling API Deprecations

1. **Monitor Deprecations**: Regularly review Kubernetes release notes and deprecation announcements.
2. **Audit Your Usage**: Use tools like `kubectl` and the Kubernetes API server logs to identify any deprecated APIs your applications are using.
3. **Plan for Migration**: Develop a plan to migrate your applications to the newer API versions before the deprecated versions are removed.

### Example of API Deprecation

Let's take an example of the `extensions/v1beta1` API group, which included resources like `Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, and `Ingress`.

1. **Announcement**: The deprecation of `extensions/v1beta1` for resources like `Deployment` and `DaemonSet` was announced, and users were advised to migrate to `apps/v1`.
2. **Deprecation Warning**: Upon using `extensions/v1beta1` for these resources, users received warnings.
3. **Removal**: In a subsequent Kubernetes release, the `extensions/v1beta1` version was removed, requiring users to use the `apps/v1` version.

### Migration Example

For example, to migrate a `Deployment` from `extensions/v1beta1` to `apps/v1`:

#### Original YAML (`extensions/v1beta1`):
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image
```

#### Updated YAML (`apps/v1`):
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image
```

### Tools for Managing Deprecations

- **kubectl deprecations**: This tool helps list and identify deprecated API versions in your cluster.
- **API Lifecycle Management Tools**: Tools like `pluto` can help detect deprecated APIs and facilitate migration efforts.

### Staying Updated

To stay current with API deprecations:

- Regularly check the [Kubernetes release notes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/).
- Subscribe to Kubernetes mailing lists and follow relevant Kubernetes SIGs (Special Interest Groups).

Understanding and managing API deprecations is crucial for maintaining a healthy and up-to-date Kubernetes environment. Regular monitoring and timely migrations will ensure that your applications continue to run smoothly through Kubernetes upgrades.
